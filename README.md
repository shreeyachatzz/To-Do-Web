# To-Do-Web
A Full Stack ‚úÖTO-DO Website‚úÖ made using **PERN** - PostGres + Express React + Node.js.
This was my first full-stack project.

## Important Libraries Used
- **uuid** : to generate unique ids
- **bcrypt** : to hash the passwords to secure them
-  **Json Web Token**: to generate tokens for the login/signup sessions

## Note:
This website was built on a local PostgreSQL database created by me. The code to use the same is available at ```server/data.sql```

## Main Issue Faced:
While I came across a thousand problems despite this being a beginner-level project, the main issue that I am yet to resolve is how to deploy it to the web on a free hosting website. If anyone has any ideas, do contact me on my socials.

## Credits: 
A million different videos on the internet and my semi-functional brain üß†.
